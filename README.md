# Tajwars News app
This is the front end architecture of a full stack web application I developed whilst at Northcoders. The front end is live at [fe-new-website](https://tajwars-news.netlify.app/) utilizing netlify, and the back end can be found at [news-api](https://tajwars-news.herokuapp.com/api/articles).

The front end architecture was built using React and CSS, implementing best practices throughout the project, including semantic HTML and optimistic rendering.
## What is Tajwars-News?

Tajwars-News is a news site which allows users to navigate and browse a multitude of articles which they can sort by various categories and selected topics. The user can also vote, leave comments and delete comments which they have previously made. For the sake of the project, as assigned, the user is set by default. The aim of this project was to create an easy to read website that can be clearly viewed in both mobile and desktop browsers, with a fully working backend that has endpoints which can be utilized.

## To run this project yourself, you will simply need to follow the following instructions:

Copy the following code one line at a time into the terminal of the text editor of your choice, I recommend VSCode:

    git clone https://github.com/Tajwar0/fe-tajwars-news
    npm install
    npm start
